/* This file contains functions for reading and writing the data to a binary file. */


/* This function reds the input data from a binary file.
This function works when the binary file has the following format:
    1) file begins with an int value that gives the number of particles
    2) continues with 6 float values that give the coordinates of the box encompassing the data (i.e. xMin, xMax, yMin, yMax, zMin, zMax)
    3) the next part of the file gives the positions of the particles which are saved as x1, y1, z1, x2, y2, z2, x3, ... (with x1 = x coordinate for particle 1, y1 = y coordinate for particle 1, etc ...)
    4) after the particle positions, come the particle weights array saved as w1, w2, w3, ... (with w1 = weight of particle 1, etc ...)
    5) after the weights array, comes the velocity array which are is saved as vx1, vy1, vz1, vx2, vy2, vz2, ... (with vx1 = the velocity along the x direction of particle 1, ...)

NOTE: In this example the data is saved in the binary file in single precision format (float 32 bytes).
